## CREDIT CARD CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
### Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach
#### Problem
AllLife Bank intends to focus on itâ€™s credit card customers in the upcoming financial year. The market research
team has advised that market penetration can be improved. Based on this, the marketing team proposes a personalized
campaign targeting both new and existing customers. It was found in the market research that customers perceive
support services as inadequate. Consequently, the operations team aims to enhance the service delivery model to
ensure quicker resolution of customer queries and requests. The Director of Marketing and the Director of Service
Delivery have decided to turn to the Data Science team for assistance.
#### Objective
The objective is to identify different segments among existing consumers based on spending patterns and past
interactions with the bank using clustering algorithms and provide recommendations to the bank on how to market to
and serve these consumers in the market.
